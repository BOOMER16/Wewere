"""TB2 - "Is this endpoint really dead?" Runtime-traffic survival model.

Real data : NASA-HTTP July 1995 access log (1.89M requests, Internet Traffic Archive).
Question   : the brief's core uncertainty - "Observe runtime traffic and retain
             uncertainty about offline or infrequent clients." When a platform
             engineer sees an endpoint with no hits for D days, how confident can
             they be that NO consumer still depends on it?

Model      : treat each resource's requests as a homogeneous Poisson process with
             rate lambda (req/day) estimated from its observed history. Under that
             model the chance of seeing zero requests across a silent window of
             length D is exp(-lambda*D). We INVERT it: for each resource, how long a
             silent window would we need before P(miss) <= alpha? That window is the
             evidence-based quarantine the retirement workflow should enforce.
             Rare/bursty resources need a far longer silence than the mean.

Validation : hold out the LAST 7 days; estimate lambda on the first 24; measure how
             many "idle in the holdout" resources actually got traffic later, and
             compare the empirical miss-rate to the Poisson prediction. This tells us
             whether a simple rate model is safe enough or over-confident (it is, for
             bursty tails -> motivates the empirically-calibrated quarantine).
