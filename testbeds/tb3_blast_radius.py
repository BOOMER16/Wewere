"""TB3 - The coordination gap, quantified. "Looks unused here, still trusted there."

Real data: NASA-HTTP Jul 1995 access log.
Idea     : The brief says a resource "can appear unused to the team deleting it while
           remaining trusted elsewhere." We make that measurable. Rank resources by
           how QUIET they are in the final 3 days (what a dashboard would show the
           engineer), then reveal the BLAST RADIUS each still carries: distinct client
           hosts and distinct /24 networks that touched it over the full history, and
           whether those clients are external (non-nasa.gov) - i.e. third parties the
           deleting team cannot see or notify.

Output   : a decision table. The headline: a large share of resources that look dead
           in a recency window still have live external dependents - the precise
           failure mode RetireSafe must block.
